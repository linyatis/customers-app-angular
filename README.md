#Customer App with AngularJS and Express Server

##Preparing the app

If you don't already have Node.js on your machine install it from http://nodejs.org.  

Go to the root directory.  Execute `npm install` to install Express and Bower.
After that, execute `bower install` to install AngularJS and ngRoute.  

Now that we have all dependencies, just run `node server.js`.  
View the application at http://localhost:8080/
